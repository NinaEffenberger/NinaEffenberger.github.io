Currently, I am a PostDoc in Reto Knutti's research group <a href="https://iac.ethz.ch/group/climate-physics.html">Climate Physics</a> at ETH Zürich. In my research, I use data to analyze the impact of climate change on renewable energy, with the goal of bridging the gaps between <span style="font-weight: bold;">climate science, machine learning, and energy modeling</span>. Please reach out to me in English or German if you're interested in these topics!

During my PhD, I was part of Nicole Ludwig's group <a href="https://www.mlsustainableenergy.com">Machine Learning in Sustainable Energy Systems</a> at the University of Tübingen where I also joined the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (<a href="https://imprs.is.mpg.de">IMPRS-IS</a>). As part of my PhD, I have conducted a half-year research stay with the <a href="https://wfrt.eoas.ubc.ca">Weather Forecast Research Team</a> at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

<!--My current research focuses on developing probabilistic machine learning algorithms for wind power forecasting. I am very interested in physics-informed machine learning and believe that choosing the right data is at least as crucial as choosing the right model. -->

Additionally, I am trained in <a href="https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org">mental health first aid</a> and <a href="https://imprs.is.mpg.de/events/healthy-minds-kickoff">promote mental health</a> in academia. I am also an alumni of the PhD initiative <a href="http://www.sustainability-phd.com">sustainAbility</a>.
