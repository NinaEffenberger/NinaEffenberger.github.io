Since July 2021 I am a PhD student in the research group “Machine Learning in Sustainable Energy Systems” within the Cluster of Excellence – Machine Learning for Science at the University of Tübingen. Furthermore, I am part of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS).

My current research focuses on developing probabilistic machine learning algorithms for wind power forecasting.

From March to July 2023, I joined the Weather Forecast Research Team at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver (Canada).
