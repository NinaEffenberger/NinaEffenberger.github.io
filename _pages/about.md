Since July 2021 I am a PhD student in the research group <a href="https://www.mlsustainableenergy.com"> Machine Learning in Sustainable Energy Systems</a> within the Cluster of Excellence – Machine Learning for Science at the University of Tübingen. Furthermore, I am part of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (<a href="https://imprs.is.mpg.de">IMPRS-IS</a>).

My current research focuses on developing probabilistic machine learning algorithms for wind power forecasting. I am very interested in physics-informed machine learning and believe that chosing the right data is at least as crucial as choosing the right model. 

During my PhD I have also conducted a research stay with the <a href="https://wfrt.eoas.ubc.ca">Weather Forecast Research Team</a> at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

Additionally, I <a href="https://imprs.is.mpg.de/events/healthy-minds-kickoff">promote mental health</a> in academia and I am also part of the PhD initiative <a href="http://www.sustainability-phd.com">sustainAbility</a>.
